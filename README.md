Uhgh another Gregtechish kind of pack

This is a test hobby to learn how to make a mod pack. It is a really hard fork of Jason MacRays Infitech 2.
My intention is to figure out how to use minetweaker and manage it with github  I will be adding and removing mods and trying to update the HQM - 

What I want is a tech pack without the magic
